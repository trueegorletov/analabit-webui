Based on the AnimatedBlob component and the screenshots, here are some ideas to make it more visually attractive:

1. **More dynamic morphing**:
   - Add more shape variations (5-7 instead of current 3)
   - Randomize transition timing between shapes
   - Add subtle rotation during transitions

2. **Enhanced gradients**:
   - Implement radial gradients in addition to linear
   - Add more color stops for richer transitions
   - Create university-themed color palettes
   - Animate gradient angle rotation

3. **Interactive elements**:
   - Add subtle mouse-follow behavior
   - Implement hover effects (gentle expansion/glow)
   - Create reactions to form interactions

4. **Visual depth improvements**:
   - Add inner glow effects
   - Implement subtle shadow animation
   - Add a second smaller blob that moves in counterpoint
   - Create layered blob effects with transparency

5. **Particle effects**:
   - Add subtle floating particles around edges
   - Implement gentle "dust" effect that follows blob movement
   - Create occasional "spark" effects at vertices

6. **Background integration**:
   - Add subtle wave or noise pattern behind the blob
   - Create complementary background elements
   - Implement parallax effects on scroll

7. **Animation refinements**:
   - Add slight pulsing/breathing animation
   - Implement easing variations for more organic movement
   - Create occasional "special" animations at intervals
