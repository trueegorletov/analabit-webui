Rewrite the logics which is used to display the UniversitySection's university-specific passing status (and highlighted table entry) for the default (--) selected drained percent (named probabilitytab in project) selector. Instead of relying on the passing_now property, always determine it like for another drained percents: the first application which has student's place less or equal with such heading's last admitted rating place (so the colored delta num will be green +x or 0 near the student's rating place in this table). Use it for both violet-checkmark-icon-prefixed status (with the name of the heading student passes to at the moment) and the selected (highlighted with violet bg) row in this university's table. If this university table is the university's one where the student submitted their original certificate to, use the violet-bg checkmark icon JUST which is used now. For universities where student has not submitted their original to, use the same (similiar styled) mark icon, but with gray bg, and the same status text (passing-now-to heading name, which is also highlighted in a table below, determined as described above), so set this gray icon for both cases when student's original university is not determined or determined to ANOTHER university, and use the current violet icon only for case where this is the original-submitted university of the student. Use "Не проходит" status only when the student is not passing now to any of the university's headings (just like now it is done for non-"--" drained percent tabs: so if the all the "deltas" (delta = last admitted rating place -student's corresponding application's rating place; displayed as colored number) lower than zero. admission-popup AdmissionStatusPopup.tsx ProgramTable.tsx UniversitySection.tsx ProbabilityTabs.tsx types.ts index.ts AdmissionStatusPopup.tsx

I need to check what went wrong with the previous edit to the AdmissionStatusPopup component.

app\components\admission-popup\AdmissionStatusPopup.tsx 135 - 170

I can see the useEffect was added but it seems there might be an issue. Let me check if there are any syntax errors or compilation issues by viewing the rest of the file.

app\components\admission-popup\AdmissionStatusPopup.tsx 200 - 250

Let me check the development server status to see if there are any compilation errors.

The server is running successfully without compilation errors. Let me test the fix by opening the popup to see if the icon logic is now working correctly for non-original universities on initial load.

I need to check what specific error occurred with the previous edit to understand why it failed and fix the issue.

The server appears to be running without compilation errors. Let me run a type check to see if there are any TypeScript errors that might be causing issues.

analabit-webui Terminal

npm run check

Let me check what scripts are available in package.json to run a proper type check.

analabit-webui Terminal

npm run

Now let me run the type-check script to see if there are any TypeScript errors in the code.

analabit-webui Terminal

npm run type-check

I see the issue - the passingSection prop was removed from the component call in page.tsx but it's still required in the component's props interface. I need to make this prop optional in the AdmissionStatusPopup component.

app\components\admission-popup\AdmissionStatusPopup.tsx 10 - 25

I need to make the passingSection prop optional in the interface and handle the case where it might not be provided.

app\components\admission-popup\AdmissionStatusPopup.tsx

+ 1 - 1

Review

Now I need to update the component destructuring and logic to handle the optional passingSection prop.
